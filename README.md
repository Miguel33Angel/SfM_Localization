# SfM_Localization

Basic SfM program that calculates the position of a camera from a video. For now it uses SuperGlue+SuperPoint and Ransac to get matches and their inliers and thus the Fundamental matrix between 2 frames (P8P).

As I've used SuperGlue and SuperPoint for this project, the licence follows the one from that repo:
